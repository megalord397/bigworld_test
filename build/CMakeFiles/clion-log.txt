CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:19 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0026 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.

CMake Warning (dev) at CMake/Modules/UrhoCommon.cmake:1481 (add_executable):
  Policy CMP0063 is not set: Honor visibility properties for all target
  types.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0063" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "Tests" of type "EXECUTABLE" has the following visibility properties
  set for CXX:

    CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET
    VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN

  For compatibility CMake is not honoring them for this target.

This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
